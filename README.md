### Hi there, Welcome to my GitHub 👋

### 💬 About me.

I am Sergio Gordillo, Frontend Developer at Profile.

Before my discovery of web development, I was working in different areas (IT Recruitment, Sport Psychology) since I studied Psychology. That means I can add a differential value when carrying out software development projects.
