### Hi there, Welcome to my GitHub 👋

### 💬 About me.

I am Sergio Gordillo, newly qualified web developer. Open to work.

Before my discovery of web development, I was working in different areas (IT Recruitment, Sport Psychology) since I studied Psychology. That means I can add a differential value when carrying out software development projects.

You can also follow me in Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/sergiogordillodev/?hl=es) and Twitter (https://twitter.com/SGordilloDev) where you can find more about my projects and technologies I am learning.
